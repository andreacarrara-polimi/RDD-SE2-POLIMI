\section{Overview}
Students\&Companies requires an architecture that can efficiently handle the complex interactions between students, companies and universities while ensuring system scalability and data security.
The platform adopts a three-tier client-server architecture, separating presentation, application logic and data management into distinct layers.
This section provides an overview of the application of this architecture to the problem at hand, while a more general discussion of the architectural style belongs in later sections.

\subsubsection{Presentation Tier}
At the presentation tier, the web app serves as the user interface, allowing S\&C to be accessed by users through their browsers.
The app is responsive, ensuring accessibility across various devices while maintaining a consistent user experience.

\subsubsection{Application Tier}
The application tier consists of three server components.

The web server handles incoming client requests, managing user sessions and providing load balancing capabilities to distribute traffic effectively across multiple instances of the application server.
The application server contains the core business logic, processing user requests to coordinate the entire internship lifecycle from application to completion.

The mail server manages the email workflow, determining when to send notifications for registration confirmations, selection updates or internship comments.
For actual email delivery, the mail server integrates with an external email provider that handles the delivery infrastructure, ensuring reliable communication.

\subsubsection{Data Tier}
The data tier employs a DBMS server to store and manage all system data.
This includes user profiles, internship positions, ongoing matches, selection processes and internship records.
The DBMS server provides structured data storage with mechanisms for maintaining integrity through transaction management and constraint enforcement, optimizing query performance through indexing and caching, and implementing access controls and encryption for sensitive user data.

Overall, this architecture enables efficient data flow while maintaining scalability and security.
When a user interacts with the web app, their request flows through the web server to one of the application server instances, which processes it leveraging the data from the DBMS server and triggers notifications through the mail server when necessary.

\section{Component View}
This section illustrates the logical organization of Students\&Companies by breaking down the system into its major software modules and mapping their relationships.
Using a series of increasingly detailed UML diagrams, the component view first presents a high-level view showing the system elements and their interactions.
It then dives into individual components, examining their low-level structures, responsibilities and interfaces, with particular attention to how they collaborate to implement the platform's functionality.

\subsection{High-Level View}
The high-level diagram below shows the components of Students\&Companies and their interactions.
The system exposes six distinct interfaces to the web app, each corresponding to a specific domain of functionality that will be further discussed in the next section.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\subsection{Low-Level View}
The low-level view below builds upon the high-level diagram above by providing a detailed representation of the internal architecture of the application server.
The codebase is structured according to the model-view-controller pattern.
In this architecture, the model acts as the core data structure of the system, representing and managing the content of the database.
In turn, managers act as controllers, bridging the model and the external interfaces, which serve as the entry points for users, ensuring a clean separation of concerns that makes the system modular, scalable and maintainable.

\section{Architectural Styles and Patterns}
This section examines the architectural styles adopted in Students\&Companies, explaining their general principles and how they guide implementation decisions.
Understanding these foundational patterns is crucial for developers working on the system, as they influence everything from component interaction to code organization.

\subsubsection{Client-Server Architecture}
The system's foundation rests on a client-server architecture, which separates systems into service requesters, called clients, and service providers, called servers.
This separation enables the user interface to evolve independently from data processing and storage, while centralizing resource management on the server.
Developers can thus focus on their domain, either crafting responsive user experiences or implementing robust business logic.

Modern applications refine this pattern through tiers, which are logical groupings of related functionality.
A three-tier architecture divides the application into three distinct layers: a presentation tier that handles the user interface, an application tier that processes business logic and a data tier that manages storage.
This separation gives developers clear boundaries for their work and lets teams works independently, reducing development bottlenecks and simplifying maintenance.

\subsubsection{REST Architecture}
REST (Representational State Transfer) guides how these tiers communicate over the web.
Originally conceived for document transfer, REST has evolved into a comprehensive style for data exchange.
Its core principle of statelessness means that servers maintain no information about past requests.
Instead, each client request must contain all necessary context.
This architectural choice significantly impacts development: backend developers need not manage complex session states, system administrators benefit from straightforward load balancing since any server can handle any request and cache developers can optimize performance by focusing solely on request parameters rather than server state.

\subsubsection{MVC Pattern}
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern organizes software into three interconnected components, each with distinct responsibilities.
The model represents the core data structure, encapsulating the database, while the view handles user interaction and presentation.
Controllers act as intermediaries, processing user requests to run business logic and coordinate workflows.
This separation of concerns enhances scalability, modularity and maintainability, allowing developers to focus on specific aspects of the system without impacting others, ultimately fostering efficient collaboration among teams.

\section{Other Design Decisions}
While architectural styles and patterns provide the system's foundation, many other critical design decisions shape its implementation.
This section outlines these choices, focusing on practical aspects that developers must consider when implementing the system.

\subsubsection{Deployment Approach}
The deployment strategy embraces horizontal scaling, running multiple application server instances rather than scaling up individual servers.
This approach requires developers to write stateless code that works across instances, but provides significant benefits: the system continues functioning even if some instances fail, resource allocation becomes more flexible as administrators can add or remove instances based on demand and load balancing becomes straightforward since any instance can handle any request.

\subsubsection{Security Implementation}
Security permeates every aspect of the design through multiple complementary layers: all client-server communication uses HTTPS encryption to protect data in transit, sensitive information receives additional encryption in the database and session management relies on time-limited tokens rather than storing session data server-side.

\subsubsection{Data Management}
Data management emphasizes both integrity and performance: the database implements transaction management to maintain consistency even during concurrent operations, constraint enforcement catches validity issues early and performance optimization through strategic indexing and caching improves response times.
