Universities focus on academic subjects and emphasize theoretical knowledge, often leaving students without sufficient practical experience.
Internships fill this gap by helping students refine their skills, understand leadership dynamics, gain insights into workplace culture and build professional networks.
However, finding internships can be challenging due to limited knowledge of relevant companies and matching the right student with the right opportunity is even harder for both students and companies, given the difficulty in assessing competencies.
In this context, Students\&Companies comes to help by connecting university students with internships offered by companies.

\section{Purpose}
Students\&Companies is designed to connect university students seeking internships with companies offering them.
The platform enables students to proactively search through a wide range of internship opportunities, filtering based on skills and interests.
It also provides personalized recommendations using advanced mechanisms, from keyword matching to statistical analysis.

Students can enhance their profiles by adding CVs and specifying job preferences, ensuring their applications are tailored and relevant.
Companies, in turn, can post detailed job descriptions, outlining project details, required skills and terms of the internship, such as compensation or mentorship opportunities, to attract the right candidates.

Beyond matching, S\&C streamlines the entire selection process.
Companies can manage interviews, use structured questionnaires to evaluate candidates and finalize decisions directly through the platform. 

S\&C also supports internships after placement.
Both students and companies can track progress, exchange comments through feedback tools and address concerns via complaint mechanisms, promoting transparency and accountability.
Universities can actively oversee students' internships, ensuring quality experiences and adequate support.

Lastly, to feed the statistical analysis applied during recommendations, S\&C collects diverse information about internships through forms. This includes feedback and suggestions from both students and companies, enhancing the platform's ability to refine and personalize its recommendation system.

\section{Scope}
To clearly understand the scope of Students\&Companies, it is helpful to characterize its context using the world and the machine model \cite{jackson1995}.
The system is divided in two: the machine, representing the software to be developed, and the world, encompassing the portion of reality it influences.
This approach allows for a formal definition of the world and shared phenomena, facilitating a better analysis of the product's domain.

\subsection{World Phenomena}
The machine does not observe the following world phenomena:
