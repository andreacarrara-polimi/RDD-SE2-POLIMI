This chapter provides a formal analysis of the system using the Alloy language and a couple of example worlds.

\section{Model}
Below is a code snippet of the model, including signatures, facts and assertions.

\section{Example Worlds}
Below are two examples of the model, demonstrating its coherence and correctness with respect to its key functionalities.

\subsection{Base World}
The following base world sets the stage by outlining the domain: two students apply for the same position, one through a recommendation and the other through a direct application.
However, only one progresses to the selection process.

\subsection{Second World}
In this world, two students apply for the same position. Both successfully advance to the selection process, but only one ultimately secures the internship.
