\section{Design Constraints}
This section outlines the constraints that define the operational boundaries and compliance requirements of the Students\&Companies platform.

\subsection{Standard compliance}
Before using S\&C, all users must explicitly accept the platform's privacy policy.
The S\&CP must comply fully with GDPR regulations, ensuring transparency in how data is collected, stored and processed.
This includes providing users with tools to manage their personal data, such as viewing, editing or deleting their information.
Secure handling is particularly important for documents like CVs, which may contain highly sensitive personal information.

\subsection{Hardware limitations}
Users are required to access the S\&CP via devices equipped with stable internet connections and modern web browsers, mainly Chrome, Safari or Edge.
While desktops and laptops provide the optimal user experience for document uploads and extensive browsing, the platform must ensure functionality on mobile devices.
Additionally, the platform must account for varying device capabilities, including lower bandwidth environments, by employing lightweight designs and caching where appropriate.
