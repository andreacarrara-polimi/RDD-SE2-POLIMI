\chapter{Introduction}
Universities teach academic subjects and emphasize theoretical knowledge.
On the other hand, internships offer a crucial dimension thus often lacking in students, that of practical experience.
They help students refine their skills, understand leadership dynamics, gain insights into workplace cultures and build professional networks.
However, finding internships is hard, due to limited knowledge of relevant companies, and finding the right fit is even harder, both for students and companies, due to difficulties in assessing competencies.
In this context, Students\&Companies comes to help by matching university students and internships offered by companies.
